#The Hard Way Is Easier
With the help of this book, you will do the incredibly simple things that all 
programmers do to learn a programming language:

```
Go through each exercise.
Type in each sample exactly.
Make it run.
```

That's it. This will be very difficult at first, but stick with it. If you go 
through this book, and do each exercise for one or two hours a night, you will 
have a good foundation for moving onto another book about Ruby to continue your 
studies. This book won't turn you into a programmer overnight, but it will get 
you started on the path to learning how to code.

This book's job is to teach you the three most essential skills that a beginning 
programmer needs to know: reading and writing, attention to detail, and spotting 
differences.

##Reading and Writing
If you have a problem typing, you will have a problem learning to code, and 
especially if you have a problem typing the fairly odd characters in source 
code. Without this simple skill you will be unable to learn even the most basic 
things about how software works.

Typing the code samples and getting them to run will help you learn the names of 
the symbols, get familiar with typing them, and get you reading the language.

*Attention to Detail*
The one skill that separates bad programmers from good programmers is attention 
to detail. In fact, it's what separates the good from the bad in any profession. 
You must pay attention to the tiniest details of your work or you will miss 
important elements of what you create. In programming, this is how you end up 
with bugs and difficult-to-use systems.

By going through this book, and copying each example exactly, you will be 
training your brain to focus on the details of what you are doing, as you are 
doing it.

*Spotting Differences*
A very important skill (that most programmers develop over time) is the ability 
to visually notice differences between things. An experienced programmer can 
take two pieces of code that are slightly different and immediately start 
pointing out the differences. Programmers have invented tools to make this even 
easier, but we won't be using any of these. You first have to train your brain 
the hard way, then use the tools.

While you do these exercises, typing each one in, you will be making mistakes. 
It's inevitable; even seasoned programmers would make a few. Your job is to 
compare what you have written to what's required, and fix all the differences. 
By doing so, you will train yourself to notice mistakes, bugs, and other 
problems.

*Do Not Copy-Paste*
You must type each of these exercises in, manually. If you copy and paste, you 
might as well not even do them. The point of these exercises is to train your 
hands, your brain, and your mind in how to read, write, and see code. If you 
copy-paste, you are cheating yourself out of the effectiveness of the lessons.

*Using the Included Videos*
Learn Ruby The Hard Way has more than 5 hours of instructional videos to help 
you with the book. There is one video for each exercise where I either 
demonstrate the exercise, or give you tips for completing the exercise. The 
best way to use the videos is to attempt or complete the exercises without them 
first, then use the videos to review what you learned or if you are stuck. This 
will slowly wean you off of using videos to learn programming and build your 
skills at understanding code directly. Stick with it, and slowly you won't need 
the videos, or any videos to learn programming. You'll be able to just read for 
the information you need.

*A Note on Practice and Persistence*
While you are studying programming, I'm studying how to play guitar. I practice 
it every day for at least two hours a day. I play scales, chords, and arpeggios 
for an hour and then learn music theory, ear training, songs, and anything else 
I can. Some days I study guitar and music for eight hours because I feel like it 
and it's fun. To me repetitive practice is natural and just how to learn 
something. I know that to get good at anything you have to practice every day, 
even if I suck that day (which is often) or it's difficult. Keep trying and 
eventually it'll be easier and fun.

Between the time that I wrote Learn Python The Hard Way and Learn Ruby The Hard 
Way I discovered drawing and painting. I fell in love with making visual art at 
the age of 39 and have been spending every day studying it in much the same way 
that I studied guitar, music, and programming. I collected books of 
instructional material, did what the books said, painted every day, and focused 
on enjoying the process of learning. I am by no means an "artist", or even that 
good, but I can now say that I can draw and paint. The same method I'm teaching 
you in this book applied to my adventures in art. If you break the problem down 
into small exercises and lessons, and do them every day, you can learn to do 
almost anything. If you focus on slowly improving and enjoying the learning 
process, then you will benefit no matter how good you are at it.

As you study this book, and continue with programming, remember that anything 
worth doing is difficult at first. Maybe you are the kind of person who is 
afraid of failure so you give up at the first sign of difficulty. Maybe you 
never learned self-discipline so you can't do anything that's "boring." Maybe 
you were told that you are "gifted" so you never attempt anything that might 
make you seem stupid or not a prodigy. Maybe you are competitive and unfairly 
compare yourself to someone like me who's been programming for more than 20 
years.

Whatever your reason for wanting to quit, keep at it. Force yourself. If you run 
into a Study Drill you can't do, or a lesson you just do not understand, then 
skip it and come back to it later. Just keep going because with programming 
there's this very odd thing that happens. At first, you will not understand 
anything. It'll be weird, just like with learning any human language. You will 
struggle with words, and not know what symbols are what, and it'll all be very 
confusing. Then one day BANG your brain will snap and you will suddenly "get it." 
If you keep doing the exercises and keep trying to understand them, you will get 
it. You might not be a master coder, but you will at least understand how 
programming works.

If you give up, you won't ever reach this point. You will hit the first 
confusing thing (which is everything at first) and then stop. If you keep 
trying, keep typing it in, trying to understand it and reading about it, you 
will eventually get it. If you go through this whole book, and you still do not 
understand how to code, at least you gave it a shot. You can say you tried your 
best and a little more and it didn't work out, but at least you tried. You can 
be proud of that.

*A Warning for the Smarties*
Sometimes people who already know a programming language will read this book and 
feel I'm insulting them. There is nothing in this book that is intended to be 
interpreted as condescending, insulting, or belittling. I simply know more about 
programming than my intended readers. If you think you are smarter than me, then 
you will feel talked down to and there's nothing I can do about that because you 
are not my intended reader.

If you are reading this book and flipping out at every third sentence because 
you feel I'm insulting your intelligence, then I have three points of advice for 
you:

```
Stop reading my book. I didn't write it for you. I wrote it for people who don't 
already know everything.
Empty before you fill. You will have a hard time learning from someone with more 
knowledge if you already know everything.
Go learn Lisp. I hear people who know everything really like Lisp.
For everyone else who's here to learn, just read everything as if I'm smiling 
and I have a mischievous little twinkle in my eye.
